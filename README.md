Tasks for the first JavaScript Essential #1 course from Cisco Networking Academy

Before starting the main course at GoIT, I was preparing for my studies and tried to solve these
tasks. Then, six months ago, I cried hysterically because I was failing.

Today, I managed to do them in one day (of course, I peeked at the GPT chat for some tips). But it
was definitely not a blind copy of his code. Everything is clear, structural and clean.

I am incredibly happy to see my progress in learning this amazing programming language
